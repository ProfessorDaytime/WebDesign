        battle one another in six mini games.  The development team was split
        into six groups of programmers that each gave me ideas and sample pieces
        for how they would like the music for their minigames to sound.  I used
        a few different genres while compiling their soundtrack.  Synthwave is a
        constant throughout, but some songs have drum and bass inspiration,
        others have future bass sounds.  There is even a racing mini game with
        Gran Turismo inspired house music.<br>With a name like Olymbots, the
        team wanted a feel of epic Olympics music with a science fictiony space
        twist.  So I took inspiration from Power Glove's theme from FarCry 3:
        Blood Dragon and added a bunch of brass to make The Olymbots Theme.
        From that theme I also arranged the songs Results Screen and Game Over.",

        woman that she needs to make up her mind and asks 'Are you gonna stay
        with the one who loves you? Or are you goin' back to the one you love?'
        I don't relate to the song and thought the lyrics were kind of pathetic,
        but I love the synths and saxophone and ooh that cheese.
        <br>I wanted to turn it into a classic Ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ à la Macintosh
        Plus - Floral Shoppe.  I used my favourite sampling technique where a
        sample in common time, 4/4, is sliced into like a waltz in 3/4 time.  I
        also employed a technique where I take a loop, extend it a beat and loop
        it back to the next beat cutting off a beat from the beginning of the
        loop to cycle through the whole loop building to the next section.<br>

        interesting work, but looking back on it now, I believe I could have made
        some better musical decisions rather than the experimental ones that I
        took.  It starts with my attempt at making deep house: Band Trips, that
        I wrote while in a hotel room and while on a bus during a band trip in
        college.  Band Trips ended up being more of a tropical house song.  The
        album featured some African inspired sounds in the songs: Radiance of
        the Dawn, Loose Safari, and Don’t Kill People.  I voted for president
        in 2012, but that was just a reelection that I didn’t put too much
        thought into because I was only just turning 18 at the time and was
        ignorant.  In early 2015 I tried to get more into politics and found
        Bernie Sanders.  Feel the Bern and Koch Heads are two politically
        motivated songs that I am proud of.  I only regret the use of using
        Michael Jackson vocal chops as percussion throughout the album.  I
        thought it was funny, edgy, unique, and interesting, but now relistening
        to a lot of the songs, it just doesn’t sound that great.  I might
        rerelease some of these songs one day without those samples… I don’t
        know.   We’ve got a blues song: Phthalo Blues, an experimental, maybe
        ‘hardstyle’ song: Magic Missile, and a harp, violin, and guitar trio:
        Cure Moderate Wounds, thrown in there.  Scorching Ray was actually
        pretty good, as my first attempt at anything resembling Ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ.
        Lastly, America’s Attention Span was my first attempt at making trap
        music.<br><br>
        Overall, I learned a lot making this album.  Some of it was decent,
        and some of it was shit. I hope you can enjoy some of it, and understand
        Professor Daytime a little better.",
